FdF is a 3D Wireframe Viewer. (macOS is only supported).
This project is about creating a simple wireframe model representation of a 3D land-scape by linking various points (x, y, z) thanks to line segments (edges).
The project must comply with the following rules:
The program has to represent the model in isometric and parallel projection.
Each number represents a point in space:
• The horizontal position corresponds to its axis.
• The vertical position corresponds to its ordinate. 
• The value corresponds to its altitude.
Executing the fdf program using the example file 42.fdf: 
./fdf maps/42.fdf
